Partis is an HMM-based framework for B-cell receptor annotation, simulation, and partitioning.
It is built on top of the [ham](https://github.com/psathyrella/ham) HMM compiler, and also uses the [ighutil](https://github.com/cmccoy/ighutil) set of Smith-Waterman annotation tools.

The manual is available [here](https://github.com/psathyrella/partis/blob/master/manual.md).

Partis is free software under the GPL v3.
